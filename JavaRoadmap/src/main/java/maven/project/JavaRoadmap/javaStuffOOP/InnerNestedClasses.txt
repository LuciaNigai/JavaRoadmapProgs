-----------KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER------

* An inner class is a class that is declared 
	inside another class, known as the outer class. 
	The inner class can access all members of the outer class,
	including private data and methods.

* Types of Inner Classes: 
	- Non-static nested class (Inner Class)
	- Static nested class
	- Method-local Inner Class
	- Anonymous Inner Class
	
* Access to Outer Class Variables: 
	An inner class can access variables and methods of its 
	outer class. However, a static inner class cannot 
	access non-static members of the outer class.

* Final or Effectively Final Variables: 
	A local inner class can only access local variables 
	that are declared final or are effectively final in 
	its enclosing scope. An effectively final variable is 
	one whose value does not change after itâ€™s initialized.

* this Keyword: 
	In the context of an inner class, the this keyword 
	refers to the current instance of the inner class. 
	To refer to the instance of the outer class, you can 
	use the syntax OuterClassName.this.
	

* Private Access: 
	Inner classes can access private members of the outer 
	class, which is beneficial for encapsulation as the 
	outer class can keep its members private.
	
* Lifetime: The lifetime of the inner class is tied to the 
	instance of the outer class.
