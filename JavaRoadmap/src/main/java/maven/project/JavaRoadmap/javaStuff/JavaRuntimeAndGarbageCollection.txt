----------------GARBAGE COLLECTION--------
* Garbage Collection is process of reclaiming the 
	runtime unused memory automatically. In other words, 
	it is a way to destroy the unused objects.

* How can an object be unreferenced?
	- By nulling the reference
	- By asigning a reference to another
	- By anonymous object etc..

* finalize() method
	The finalize() method is invoked each time before 
	the object is garbage collected. This method can be 
	used to perform cleanup processing.
	 
*gc() method
	The gc() method is used to invoke the garbage 
	collector to perform cleanup processing.

* Garbage collection is performed by a daemon thread 
	called Garbage Collector(GC). This thread calls 
	the finalize() method before object is garbage 
	collected.
	
------------------JAVA RUNTIME CLASS---------
* Java Runtime class is used to interact with java 
	runtime environment. Java Runtime class provides 
	methods to execute a process, invoke GC, get 
	total and free memory etc. There is only one 
	instance of java.lang.Runtime class is available 
	for one java application.
