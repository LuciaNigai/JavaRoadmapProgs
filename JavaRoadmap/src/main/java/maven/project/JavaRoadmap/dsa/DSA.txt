* Data Structure is a way to organized data in such a way that it can be used 
	efficiently.
* Non-primitive data structures:
	- linear -> The arrangement of data in a sequential manner is known as a linear data 
		structure. The data structures used for this purpose are Arrays, Linked list, Stacks, 
		and Queues. 
	- non-linear  -> When one element is connected to the 'n' number of elements known as a 
		non-linear data structure. The best example is trees and graphs. In this case, the 
		elements are arranged in a random manner.

* Basic operations performed on the data structures:
	- Searching
	- Sorting
	- Insertion
	- Updation
	- Deletion
	- Merge
	- Selection
	- Splitting

* For example, a stack is an ADT (Abstract data type) which uses either arrays or linked list 
	data structure for the implementation. Therefore, we conclude that we require some data 
	structure to implement a particular ADT.

* An ADT tells what is to be done and data structure tells how it is to be done. In other 
	words, we can say that ADT gives us the blueprint while data structure provides the 
	implementation part.

* Algoritm is a process or set of rules required to perform calculations or some problem-solving
	operations especially by a computer.
